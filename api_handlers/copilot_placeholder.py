## 🤖 AI Code Analysis

### ✅ Code Quality Score: 8.5/10

### 📊 Detailed Review

#### 🎯 **Problem Understanding**
- The solution correctly addresses the problem requirements
- Algorithm choice is appropriate for the given constraints
- Edge cases are mostly handled

#### 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

**Strengths:**
- Clean code structure with logical flow
- Good use of Python built-in functions
- Efficient algorithm implementation
- Proper variable naming conventions

**Areas for Improvement:**
- Missing type hints in function signatures
- Some functions could benefit from docstrings
- Error handling could be more comprehensive

#### 📝 **Code Style Analysis**

**PEP 8 Compliance:**
- ✅ Proper indentation
- ✅ Consistent naming conventions
- ⚠️ Some lines exceed 79 characters
- ⚠️ Missing blank lines in some sections

**Suggestions:**
- Add type hints to function parameters
- Use f-strings instead of .format() for better readability
- Consider using dataclasses for complex data structures
- Add proper error handling with try-catch blocks

#### 🚀 **Performance Considerations**

**Current Performance:**
- Time Complexity: O(n) - optimal for this use case
- Space Complexity: O(n) - reasonable for the problem size

**Optimization Opportunities:**
- Consider using list comprehensions for better readability
- Could use `filter()` and `map()` for functional programming approach
- Memory usage is acceptable for the given constraints

#### 🛡️ **Security & Best Practices**

**Good Practices Observed:**
- No hardcoded sensitive information
- Input validation present
- Proper use of context managers

**Recommendations:**
- Add input sanitization for user-provided data
- Consider using environment variables for configuration
- Implement logging for debugging purposes

### 🎯 **Action Items**

**High Priority:**
1. Add comprehensive error handling with try-catch blocks
2. Implement type hints throughout the codebase
3. Add docstrings to all public functions

**Medium Priority:**
1. Optimize imports and remove unused dependencies
2. Add unit tests for critical functions
3. Consider using dataclasses for complex data structures

**Low Priority:**
1. Add performance monitoring
2. Implement caching for expensive operations
3. Add code formatting with tools like `black`

### 📈 **Code Metrics**

| Metric | Current | Target |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Cyclomatic Complexity | 3 | < 5 |
| Lines of Code | 45 | < 100 |
| Test Coverage | 0% | > 80% |
| Documentation | 20% | > 90% |

### 🔮 **Future Enhancements**

1. **Modularization**: Break down large functions into smaller, focused ones
2. **Configuration**: Move hardcoded values to configuration files
3. **Logging**: Add structured logging for better debugging
4. **Testing**: Implement comprehensive test suite
5. **Documentation**: Add detailed README and API documentation
